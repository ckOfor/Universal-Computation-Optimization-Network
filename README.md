## Optimization Strategies

UCON implements several advanced optimization strategies:

1. **Quantum-Classical Hybridization**: Routing appropriate subproblems to quantum processors
2. **Spatio-Temporal Computation Shifting**: Moving computation to optimal locations and times based on energy availability
3. **Probabilistic Approximation**: Using statistical methods to approximate solutions when exact solutions are intractable
4. **Massively Parallel Evolutionary Algorithms**: Evolving solution approaches across distributed systems
5. **Complexity Reduction Transformation**: Automatically transforming problems into lower complexity classes where possible

## Economic Model

UCON operates on a dual-token economy:

- **Computation Tokens (CT)**: Represent standardized units of computational work
- **Efficiency Tokens (ET)**: Awarded for improvements to overall network efficiency

The relationship between energy consumption, computation performed, and efficiency improvements drives a self-optimizing marketplace that continuously reduces the energy cost of computation.

## Governance

UCON employs a three-tiered governance system:
- **Technical Council**: Oversees protocol upgrades and standards
- **Resource Providers**: Influences resource pricing and allocation policies
- **Problem Submitters**: Guides problem classification and solver prioritization

Decisions require distributed consensus with weights based on proven contributions to network efficiency.
